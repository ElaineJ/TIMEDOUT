# TIMEDOUT


GAME DESCRIPTION - 
The ultimate goal of this game is to click the button when the red led lights up. The game will get tougher as the speed increases once the 8 bit alu finishes its cycle. The speed will not be very noticeable at first but as the game continues, you will have to watch out for the right timing to click the button to progress to the next level. There are 5 levels in total upon completion of all you win the game!


Rules -
Press the button when it’s at the red light. Yup it’s that simple.
